    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine\n",
    "- Internet connection for pulling dependencies\n",
    "- (Optional) Docker Hub account for pushing/pulling the image\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Image\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Build from Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository containing the Dockerfile:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/mtinti/biojupyter.git\n",
    "   cd biojupyter\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build the Docker image:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker build -t biojupyter .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This process may take 15-30 minutes depending on your internet speed and machine capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pulling the Image\n",
    "\n",
    "If the image is already available on Docker Hub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Pull the latest version\n",
    "docker pull mtinti/biojupyter:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Start JupyterLab server:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app --rm biojupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command:\n",
    "- Maps port 8888 of the container to port 8888 on your host\n",
    "- Mounts your current directory to `/app` in the container\n",
    "- Automatically removes the container when stopped (`--rm`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "Once running, access JupyterLab by opening a web browser and navigating to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8888\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing rpy2 Functionality\n",
    "If you clone the repository and start the container from inside the repo directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/mtinti/biojupyter.git\n",
    "cd biojupyter\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app --rm biojupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can open and run the included nbs/00_test.ipynb notebook to verify that rpy2 is working correctly. \n",
    "- This notebook demonstrates calling R functions from Python and passing data between the two languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The environment is configured with no password or token for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Custom Port\n",
    "\n",
    "If port 8888 is already in use on your machine:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 9999:8888 -v $(pwd):/app --rm biojupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then access JupyterLab at `http://localhost:9999`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment provides two Jupyter kernels:\n",
    "- **Python 3.10 (venv)**: Python kernel with all the bioinformatics packages installed\n",
    "- **R**: R 4.6 kernel with Bioconductor packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Files in your current directory (where you run the `docker run` command) are accessible within JupyterLab under the `/app` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Shell Access\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a bash shell within the container:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash biojupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activate Python Environment Inside Container\n",
    "\n",
    "When accessing the shell, activate the Python virtual environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source /opt/venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n"
